⚡️Colour Choices⚡️
We chose a very light grey because the colour white can be too bright for human eyes, hence light grey is softer for our eyes to read. And we chose yellow as the secondary/button colour because yellow is the colour of 2021, and it also represents Australia.

⚡️Dashboard Design⚡️
We wanted to keep the dashboard as simple as possible, but not empty. Before users adding any notes, we added a quote in the middle of the screen so the whole dashboard is not too empty.

⚡️Ideas⚡️
- do a menu with the user profile, settings
- options to show the completed and pending?
