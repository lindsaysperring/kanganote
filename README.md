# Notes Web App
Advanced Web Development, Assignment 2, Group AB

## About
As a team we decided to create a note taking web application, this app would take inspiration from other popular note taking apps such as Evernote, 
Apple Notes and Google Keep. The main purpose of this app would be to write and store notes that can easily be accessed from anywhere. This website 
will target users aged 16+ that can find usefulness in keeping notes for studying or even remembering a shopping list.
