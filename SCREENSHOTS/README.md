A folder SCREENSHOTS containing screenshots (or maybe a video) of key pages in your application and a README.md file that describes what they show.

The homepage is the default page shown when you open the Kanganote web application. 
The left side of the screen includes the application title, ‘Kanganote’ with __ company introductions and an accompanying logo underneath. On the right side of the screen is the signup form. Each of the form inputs
are required to successfully submit the form. On submission of the form you can then choose to Login with the details you 
just signed up with.

The Login Screen provides users with a login form on the right side of the screen. In this form the user is
required to enter the email address and password associated with their Kanganote account. If the
login credentials are correlated to a Kanganote account, on submission the user will be returned
back to the home screen.

In the case that not all inputs were entered into the login form or information did not match an existing
Kanganote user account, an error message corresponding to errors that have occurred will be
displayed on the screen.

If a user does not have a Kanganote account they can create one by accessing the ‘Sign up’ page.
The ‘Sign up’ page is accessible by clicking on the ‘Click to sign up’ prompt located under the
submission button.
